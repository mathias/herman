This project is a combination of Pallet recipes to create a Hadoop cluster (or a single Hadoop node locally with Virtualbox) and Cascalog to write queries on them.

The name is in reference to Woody Herman and this Thundering Herd. Herman was a Jazz clarinetist originally from my hometown of Milwaukee, WI.

> Woodrow Charles "Woody" Herman (May 16, 1913 – October 29, 1987) was an American jazz clarinetist, alto and soprano saxophonist, singer, and big band leader. Leading various groups called "The Herd," Herman was one of the most popular of the 1930s and 1940s bandleaders.
